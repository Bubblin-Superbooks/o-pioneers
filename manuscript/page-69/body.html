You are nearly nineteen now, and I wouldn't have you stay. I've always hoped you would get away. But I can't help feeling scared when I think how I will miss you—more than you will ever know.” She brushed the tears from her cheeks, not trying to hide them.</p><p>“But, Alexandra,” he said sadly and wistfully, “I've never been any real help to you, beyond sometimes trying to keep the boys in a good humor.”</p><p>Alexandra smiled and shook her head. “Oh, it's not that. Nothing like that. It's by understanding me, and the boys, and mother, that you've helped me. I expect that is the only way one person ever really can help another. I think you are about the only one that ever helped me. Somehow it will take more courage to bear your going than everything that has happened before.”</p></div> </div>
