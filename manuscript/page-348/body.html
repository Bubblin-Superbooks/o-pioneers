The warden was a German, a ruddy, cheerful-looking man who had formerly been a harness-maker. Alexandra had a letter to him from the German banker in Hanover.

I was afraid he might be quarrelsome and get himself into more trouble. Mr. Schwartz, if you have time, I would like to tell you a little about Frank Shabata, and why I am interested in him.”</p><p>The warden listened genially while she told him briefly something of Frank's history and character, but he did not seem to find anything unusual in her account.</p></div> </div>
