Very much in love with him. I think I was the one who suggested our running away. From the first it was more my fault than his.”</p><p>Emil turned away his face.</p><p>“And now,” Marie went on, “I've got to remember that. Frank is just the same now as he was then, only then I would see him as I wanted him to be. I would have my own way. And now I pay for it.”</p><p>“You don't do all the paying.”</p><p>“That's it. When one makes a mistake, there's no telling where it will stop. But you can go away; you can leave all this behind you.”</p><p>“Not everything. I can't leave you behind. Will you go away with me, Marie?”</p></div> </div>
