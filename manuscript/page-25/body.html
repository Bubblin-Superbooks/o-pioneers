<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">to-day?” Carl asked.</p><p>“Yes. I'm almost sorry I let them go, it's turned so cold. But mother frets if the wood gets low.” She stopped and put her hand to her forehead, brushing back her hair. “I don't know what is to become of us, Carl, if father has to die. I don't dare to think about it. I wish we could all go with him and let the grass grow back over everything.”</p><p>Carl made no reply. Just ahead of them was the Norwegian graveyard, where the grass had, indeed, grown back over everything, shaggy and red, hiding even the wire fence. Carl realized that he was not a very helpful companion, but there was nothing he could say.</p><p>“Of course,” Alexandra went on, steadying her voice a little, “the boys are strong and work hard, but we've always depended so on father that I don't see how we can go ahead. I almost feel as if there were nothing to go ahead for.”</p></div> </div>
