<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">but I'm glad to get this place mowed! When I heard it raining in the night, I thought maybe you would come and do it for me to-day. The wind wakened me. Didn't it blow dreadfully? Just smell the wild roses! They are always so spicy after a rain. We never had so many of them in here before. I suppose it's the wet season. Will you have to cut them, too?”</p><p>“If I cut the grass, I will,” Emil said teasingly. “What's the matter with you? What makes you so flighty?”</p><p>“Am I flighty? I suppose that's the wet season, too, then. It's exciting to see everything growing so fast,—and to get the grass cut! Please leave the roses till last, if you must cut them. Oh, I don't mean all of them, I mean that low place down by my tree, where there are so many. Aren't you splashed! Look at the spider-webs all over the grass. Good-bye. I'll call you if I see a snake.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">She tripped away and Emil stood looking after her.</p></div> </div>
